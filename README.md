# Chatting-Application
This Java Chatting Application demonstrates client-server communication using sockets and multi-threading. It serves as a foundational project for understanding network programming and real-time messaging applications.
## Features
- ✅ **Real-time messaging** between client and server  
- ✅ **Multi-threaded server** to handle multiple clients simultaneously  
- ✅ **TCP socket connection** for reliable data transfer  
- ✅ **Exception handling** for stable and secure communication  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Networking API:** Java Sockets  
- **Operating System:** Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)  

## How It Works
1. **Server** starts and listens for incoming client connections.  
2. **Client** connects to the server via a **TCP socket**.  
3. Messages are exchanged between the client and server using **input/output streams**.  
4. **Multi-threading** ensures multiple clients can communicate with the server simultaneously.
